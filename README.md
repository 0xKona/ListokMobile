# Listok Mobile

Listok Mobile is a react native applicationthat allows the user to create and edit recipes and create "Listoks" which are a weekly meal plan and can be used to generate shopping lists making it easy to plan meals and the weekly shopping.

>**Important Note**: Currently the app only runs on iOS, this is an issue with how the google login works on android that I haven't got around to investigating yet. As far as I'm aware that's the only hurdle to getting it running on android at this time.
